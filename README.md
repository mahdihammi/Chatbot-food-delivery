I built chatbot for tunisian food delivery using DialogFlow from google <br>
This project covers dialogflow fundamentals such as intents, entities, contexts... <br>
Here is the interface of DialogFlow when the chatbot creation is done <br>

The Chatbot is able to capture none accurate words, like when you say "Ma9loub" instead of "Makloub" and so on <br>
